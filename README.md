#### Bachelor project on an application of deep learning for natural language processing and image processing for image search

###### Developed By:
##### Tareq Habbab
##### Youssef Ibrahim


**Project Description**

The main purpose of this application is to provide a service for all Android system users that would make the image search easier and better.

Currently, the image search is done in many different ways and only recently the idea of searching based on object detection in images was introduced.
However, in this application, the natural language processing algorithms are applied to provide better results and higher chances of finding relevant images.
Also, the image processing algorithms are used to detect the objects in the images.

The user interface shall also play a relevantly big role of making this application intuitively easy for almost anybody to use.
The user interface will be simple yet effective.

Finally, and most importantly, the application is open for extension and modification since a lot of features can be added to it.
Therefore, the extension of the system is also considered to provide the possibility to make the application even better and more useful.

**System Requirements**
1. The system requires a stable internet connection of at least 10 Mbps.

2. The system shall run on Android devices with the following specifications:

(a) Operation System:≥Android (8.0) Oreo operating system.
(b) RAM:≥8 GB RAM

**Installation Instructions**
The Android application is currently in beta version (to avoid paying for services that are not necessary for the current stage).
Therefore, the application is not yet available on the *Play Store* (Android's applications store).

However the application's APK file is hosted and available for download through the following [link].
